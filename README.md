# Logistic_regression_rock_or_mine_sonar_kivy_GUI

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify objects detected by sonar signals as either rocks or mines. Utilizing logistic regression, the model is trained on a dataset of sonar readings to make accurate predictions. This classification is crucial for applications in marine navigation, underwater exploration, and military operations.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of sonar signal readings, with each reading represented by 60 numerical features. The features correspond to energy values in different frequency bands. The target variable indicates whether the object is a rock (`R`) or a mine (`M`).
